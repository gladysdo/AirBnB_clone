AirBnB clone - The console

Project Description.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
Each task is linked and will help you to:

1. put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take 
	care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
2. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: 
	Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
3. create all classes used for AirBnB 
	(User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
4. create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

USAGE:
1. Start: clone https://github.com/niialabi/AirBnB_clone.git
2. Usage: ./console.py
